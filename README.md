Mac Gyver's maze

Lets make MacGyver escape from this maze.

Use the keyboard's arrows to move MacGyver across the maze.

In order to win, pick up the 3 items. An ether bottle, a tube and a sting.
MacGyver will make a syringe out of them.
Pick up the syringe and make the warden sleep with it.

If you face the warden without having all the items, the syringe won't appear and then you will lose.

You'll be able to leave the game at any moment by pressing "e".
To return to the start menu press "m" any time.

HAVE A NICE GAME!
